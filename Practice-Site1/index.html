               I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
                current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
                got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I
            joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
            heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
            shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
            grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
            VR startup. ”

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who
            did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning
            from their experiences was easy.

            the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
            myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
            You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
            community of smart and amazing people. ”

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line
            of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
            learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
            The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
            next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
            often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
            developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
